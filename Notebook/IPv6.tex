\chapter{IPv6}

Several techniques have been developed to accommodate a variety of transition IPv4-to-IPv6 scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dual-stack:} A device interface is running both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols enabling it to communicate with either network.
\item \textbf{Tunneling:} The process of encapsulating an IPv6 packet inside an IPv4 packet. This allows the IPv6 packet to be transmitted over an IPv4-only network.
\item \textbf{Translation:} Implementing NAT to translate IPv6 to IPv4 addresses.
\end{itemize}
