\chapter{Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)}

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{IDS}

Firewalls cannot protect against malware and zero-day attacks. A zero-day attack is a computer attack that tries to exploit software vulnerabilities that are unknown or undisclosed by the software vendor. \\

\textbf{Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)} copies the actual traffic stream and analyzes the copied traffic. IDS works offline, which means several things:

\begin{itemize}
\item IDS passively monitor network traffic without preventing attacks.
\item IDS device is physically positioned in the network so that traffic must be mirrored in order to reach it
\item Network traffic does not pass through the IDS unless it is mirrored
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Advantage:} No impact on the network (delay, jitter). \textbf{Disadvantage:} cannot stop malicious packets, cannot correct tuning required for response action.

\subsection{IPS}

Unlike IDS, \textbf{Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)} is implemented in \textbf{inline mode}. This means that all ingress and egress traffic must flow through it for processing. IPS can detect and immediately solve a network problem. \\

\textbf{Advantages:} stop malicious packets, utilize stream normalization\footnote{a technique used to reconstruct the data stream when the attack occurs over multiple data segments.}. \textbf{Disadvantage:} some impact on network (delay, jitter), IPS overloading or improper configuration negatively affect the network.\\

The biggest difference between IDS and IPS is that an IPS responds immediately and does not allow any malicious traffic to pass, whereas no action is taken on malicious packets by the IDS.

\subsection{Compare IDS and IPS}

IDS and IPS technologies share several characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\item Deployed as sensors
\item Use signatures\footnote{A signature is a set of rules that an IDS or IPS uses to detect malicious activity.} to detect patterns in network traffic
\item Can detect atomic signature patterns (single-packet) or composite signature patterns (multi-packet)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IPS technologies}

There are two primary kinds of IPSs available: host-based and network-based. \\

\textbf{Network-based IPS} devices are implemented at designated network points that enable security managers to monitor network activity while it is occurring, regardless of the location of the attack target. One limitation of them is that they cannot monitor/inspect encrypted packets.\\

\textbf{Host-based IPS (HIPS}) is software installed on a single host. Two disadvantages of deploying HIPS are (1) that it cannot create a complete view of the network and (2) every host operating system within the organization must be supported. However, an advantage of using HIPS is that it can monitor and protect the operating system as well as critical system processes on each network host.

\section{IPS Signatures}

\subsection{Characteristics}

Signatures have three distinctive attributes: Type, Trigger (alarm), Action.

\subsection{Type}

Signature types are generally categorized as atomic or composite.\\

An \textbf{atomic signature} consists of a \emph{single} packet, activity, or event that is examined. Because these signatures can be matched on a single event, they do not require an intrusion system to maintain state\footnote{State refers to situations in which multiple packets of information are required, but the packets of information are not necessarily received at the same time.} information. Detecting atomic signatures consumes minimal resources. For example, a LAND attack has an atomic signature because it sends a spoofed TCP SYN packet, therefore, one packet is enough to identify this type of attack.\\

A \textbf{composite signature} is a \emph{stateful} signature which identifies a sequence of packets. Because some attacks involve multiple packets, an IPS sensor must maintain the state information. However, an IPS sensor cannot maintain the state information indefinitely. The ''life time`` of state information is known as the \textbf{event horizon}.

All signatures are contained in a signature file and uploaded to an IPS on a regular basis.\\

\textbf{SME} (signature micro-engine) categorizes signatures in group and scans for multiple signatures based on group characteristics, instead of one at a time. When IDS or IPS is enabled, an SME is loaded or built on the router. When an SME is built, the router might need to compile the regular expression\footnote{A regular expression is a systematic way to specify a search for a pattern in a series of bytes.} found in a signature. \\

Atomic and composite packets are scanned by the SMEs to recognize the protocols contained in the packets. Then, each SME extracts values from the packet and passes portions of the packet to the regular expression engine. The regular expression engine can search for multiple patterns at the same time. 

\subsection{Triggers}

\subsubsection{Trigger mechanism}

The heart of any IPS signature is the Trigger mechanism, which detects malicious activities. There are four types of trigger mechanisms:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pattern-based detection} (signature-based detection) compares the network traffic to a database of known attacks. The mechanism is only suitable for the suspect packets that are associated with \emph{services} or \emph{ports}. However, it cannot deal with unknown protocols and attacks.

\item \textbf{Anomaly-based detection} (profile-based detection) defines a profile of what is considered normal for the network. This normal profile can be learned by monitoring activity on the network, or be based on a defined specification, such as an RFC. After defining normal activity, the signature triggers an action if excessive activity occurs beyond a specified threshold that is not included in the normal profile. \textbf{Advantage:} new and previously unpublished attacks can be detected. \textbf{Disadvantage:} Attack activity may be defined as normal traffic; Difficult to correlate alert back to a specific attack.

\item \textbf{Policy-based detection} (behavior-based detection) defines suspicious behaviors based on \emph{historical} analysis. The use of behaviors enables a single signature to cover an entire class of activities without having to specify each individual situation.

\item \textbf{Honey pot-based detection} uses a dummy server to attract attacks. . Antivirus and other security vendors tend to use them for research.

\item \textbf{Protocol decodes:} This mechanism breaks down a packet into the fields of a protocol, and then search for specific patterns in a specific protocol field. \textbf{Advantage}: enable a more granular inspection of traffic and reduces the number of false positives.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Alarm type}

Triggering mechanisms mentioned above can generate alarms that are false positives or false negatives. These alarms must be addressed when implementing an IPS sensor. The table \ref{AlarmType} summarizes the following four types of alarms:

\tableStart[\caption{Alarm types}\label{AlarmType}] { |l|l|l|l| }
\head{Alarm type} & \head{Traffic} & \head{Alarm} & \head{Outcome}\w
False Positive & normal &  $\bullet$ & tune alarm\w
False Negative & attack & & tune alarm\w
True Positive & attack & $\bullet$ & ideal setting\w
True Negative & normal & & ideal setting\w
\tableEnd

A false positive occurs when an IPS mistakes normal traffic for malicious ones and generates an alarm. A false negative is when an IPS detects malicious activities but fails to generate an alarm. A true positive alarm means that IPS generates an alarm in response to attack traffic. A true negative describes a situation in which normal network traffic does not generate an alarm.

\subsection{Actions}

\paragraph{Alerts:} After an alarm is generated, IPS generates report those to the administrator using an \textbf{alert}. There are two ways to generate an alert:

\begin{itemize}
\item  \textbf{Atomic alerts} are generated every time a signature triggers.
\item \textbf{Summary alert:} a single atomic alert is generated for the first detection of an attack. Then the duplicate alarms are counted, but not sent, for a specific time period. When the specified time period is reached, an alert is sent that indicates the number of alarms that occurred during the time interval.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Logging:} this activity may start on packets that contain attacker's address (logging attacker packets), or attacker-victim address pair (logging pair packet), or victim's address (logging victim packet).


\paragraph{Deny:} IPS terminates the current and future packets from a particular attacker address for a period of time. If attacker A is currently denied, but issues another attack, then the timer for attacker A is reset and this attacker remain denied until the timer expires. IPS also denies TCP connection.


\paragraph{Blocking} is the action that updates ACL on \emph{one} of the infrastructure devices. After a configured period of time, the IPS device removes the ACL. This action allows a single IPS device can stop traffic at multiple locations throughout the network, regardless of the location of the IPS device. 


\subsection{Logging and management task} 

\paragraph{SDEE:} When an attack signature is detected, the Cisco IOS IPS feature can send either a syslog message or an alarm in SDEE (Secure Device Event Exchange) format, as shown in the figure \ref{SDEE}. SDEE uses HTTP and XML to provide a standardized approach. Administrators must also enable HTTP or HTTPS on the router when enabling SDEE. The use of HTTPS ensures that data is secured as it traverses the network.\\

When sending IPS notification with SDEE format, the buffer on the router stores up to 200 events by default. If a smaller buffer is requested, all stored events are lost. If a larger buffer is requested, all stored events are saved. The default buffer can be altered with the \code{ip sdee events <number>} command. All stored events are lost when Cisco SDEE notification is disabled. A new buffer is allocated when the notifications are re-enabled.\\

\end{figure}

There are three GUI-based IPS device managers available: Cisco Configuration Professional, Cisco IPS Manager Express (IME), and Cisco Security Manager.

\subsection{Global correlation}
 
When participating in Global correlation, IPS receives regular threat updates from a database called the Cisco SensorBase Network. This database provides information to the IPS sensor about IP addresses with a \emph{reputation}, as shown in the figure \ref{GlobalCorrelation}. The sensor uses this information to determine which actions to perform when harmful traffic is received from a host with a known reputation. Since the global correlation database changes rapidly, the sensor must periodically download global correlation updates from the global correlation servers. It is possible to view reputation scores in events and see the reputation score of attackers.\\

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\caption{Global Correlation}\label{GlobalCorrelation}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{pictures/GlobalCorrelation.PNG}
\end{figure}



The SensorBase Network is part of \textbf{Security Intelligence Operation (SIO)}, a back-end security ecosystem. SIO detects, researches and analyzes threats, and provides real-time security updates. SIO consists of three elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Threat intelligence} from the Cisco SensorBase Network
\item \emph{Threat Operations Center}, which is the combination of automated and human processing and analysis
\item \emph{Automated and best practices content} that is pushed to network elements in the form of dynamic updates
\end{itemize}

%A \textbf{reputation} is based on a commonly held opinion. IP addresses, mail servers, URLs, and other entities can all have a reputation. Many of today’s network protection technologies and filtering systems depend on lists to determine if the information is good (whitelist) or bad (blacklist). IPS sensors use reputation filters to deny IP addresses or URLs that are blacklisted before the sensor does further analysis on the traffic.
\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Configuration}

\subsubsection{Step 1. Download the IOS IPS files}

Prior to configuring IPS, it is necessary to download the IOS IPS signature package files, and a public crypto key from cisco.com. Only registered customers can download the package files and key.

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|IOS-Sxxx-CLI.pkg| -- The latest signature package.
\item \verb|realm-cisco.pub.key.txt| -- The public crypto key used by IOS IPS.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 2. Create an IOS IPS configuration directory in Flash}

This step creates a directory in flash to store the signature files and configurations using \code{mkdir <dir-name>} privileged EXEC command. Other useful commands include \code{rename <current-name> <new-name>} which allows the name of the directory to be changed. 

\subsubsection{Step 3. Configure an IOS IPS Crypto Key}

The third step configures the crypto key used by IOS IPS. This key is located in the \verb|realm-cisco.pub.key.txt| file that was obtained in Step 1. The crypto key verifies the digital signature for the master signature file \verb|sigdef-default.xml|. The content of the file is signed by a Cisco private key to guarantee its authenticity and integrity.\\

Open the text file to configure the IOS IPS crypto key. Next, copy the contents of the file, and paste the contents to the router at the global configuration prompt. The text file issues the various commands to generate the RSA key.\\

If the key is configured incorrectly, an error message is generated as follow

\begin{verbatim}
%IPS-3-INVALID_DIGITAL_SIGNATURE: Invalid Digital Signature found (key not found)
\end{verbatim}

In such case, the key must be removed and then reconfigured. Use the \code{no crypto key pubkey-chain rsa} and the \code{no named-key realm-cisco.pub signature} commands. Then repeat the procedure in Step 3 to reconfigure the key. Finally, enter the \code{show run} command to confirm that the crypto key is configured.

\subsubsection{Step 4. Enable IOS IPS}

The fourth step is to configure IOS IPS, which is a process that consists of four sub-steps.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Identify the IPS rule name and specify the location:} Create a rule name associated with an optional extended or standard ACL. All traffic that is permitted by the ACL is subject to inspection by the IPS. Next, configure the IPS signature storage location as directory \verb|flash:IPS| (created in step 2).

\item \textbf{Enable SDEE and logging event notification:} To use SDEE, the HTTP or HTTPS server must first be enabled with the \code{ip http server} or \code{ip https server} command. Enable SDEE event notification by using the \code{ip ips notify sdee} command. The buffer size can be altered with the \code{ip sdee events} command. The \code{clear ip ips sdee} command clears SDEE events or subscriptions.

\item \textbf{Enable syslog:} Logging notification is enabled by default. If the logging console is enabled, IPS log messages are displayed on the console. Use the \code{ip ips notify log} command to enable logging.

\item \textbf{Configure the signature category:} All signatures are grouped into categories. The three most common categories are \verb|all|, \verb|basic|, and \verb|advanced|. The signatures that IPS uses to scan traffic can be retired or unretired. \textbf{Retiring} a signature means that IPS does not compile that signature into memory for scanning. \textbf{Un-retiring} a signature instructs IPS to compile the signature into memory and use it to scan traffic. When IOS IPS is first configured, all signatures in the all category should be retired. Then, selected signatures should be unretired in a less memory-intensive category. 

\item \textbf{Apply the IPS rule to interfaces} 
\end{enumerate}

Below is an example of IPS configuration:

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\caption{Topology for IPS example}\label{IPSexample}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{pictures/IPSexample.PNG}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{IPSexample}, the IPS inspection is configured on the S0/0/0 interface with inbound direction, but the ACL source address range is 192.168.0.0/16 and the traffic type is http established, there will be no traffic to match these criteria (note, there is no web server on LAN 1 or LAN 2). Hence no traffic inspection will take place.

\note Do not unretire the \verb|all| category. The \verb|all| signature category contains all signatures in a signature release. The IPS cannot compile and use all the signatures at one time because it will run out of memory.

\note The order in which the signature categories are configured on the router is also important. IOS IPS processes the category commands in the order listed in the configuration. Some signatures belong to multiple categories. If multiple categories are configured and a signature belongs to more than one of them, IOS IPS uses the signature’s properties in the last configured category, for example, retired, unretired, or actions.

\subsubsection{Step 5. Loading IOS IPS Signature Package to the Router}

The last step is for the administrator to upload the signature package to the router. The most common methods are FTP or TFTP. 

\begin{sexylisting}{Enable IPS}
ip ips name IOSIPS list ALLOW-HTTP
ip ips config location flash:IPS

ip http server
ip https server

ip ips notify sdee
ip sdee events 500

ip ips notify log
logging 192.168.10.100
logging on

ip ips signature-category
  category all
  retired true
exit
  category ios_ips basic
  retired false
end  

conf t

interface g0/0
  ip ips IOSIPS in
interface g0/1
  ip ips IOSIPS in
  ip ips IOSIPS out
end

copy tftp://192.168.1.3/IOS-S416-CLI.pkg idconf
# copy ftp://ftp_user:password@Server_IP_addr/signature_packg  idconf

show ip ips signature count 

clear ip ips sdee {events | subscription}
\end{sexylisting}

\subsection{Modification}

\begin{sexylisting}{Retire a specific signature}
ip ips signature-definition
  signature 6130 10
  status
    retired true
end 
\end{sexylisting}

\begin{sexylisting}{Change actions of a signature}
ip ips signature-definition
  signature 6130 10
  engine
    event-action produce alert
    event-action deny-packet-inline
    event-action reset-tcp-connection
end    
\end{sexylisting}

\tableStart[\caption{Parameters of event-action command}\label{event-action}] {|l|p{8\xm}|}
\verb|deny-attacker-inline| & Terminates the current and future packets from a particular attacker address for a period of time\w
\verb|deny-connection-inline| & Terminates packets come on this TCP flow.\w
\verb|deny-packet-inline| & Terminates the packet.\w
\verb|produce-alert| & Writes event to Event Store as an alert.\w
\verb|reset-tcp-connection| & Send TCP reset signal and terminate the TCP flow. Only works on TCP signatures that analyze a single connection. Not work for sweeps or floors.\w
\tableEnd

\begin{sexylisting}{Change actions of a signature category}
ip ips signature-definition
  category ios_ips basic
    event-action produce alert
    event-action deny-packet-inline
    event-action reset-tcp-connection
end  
\end{sexylisting}

The IOS command \code{ip ips signature-definition} is used to configure a specific signature, including retire/unretire and event action. To configure a signature category, the command \code{ip ips signature-category} is used.\\

Use the \verb|clear ip ips config| command to disable IPS, remove all IPS configuration entries, and release dynamic resources. The \verb|clear ip ips stat| command resets statistics on packets analyzed, and alarms sent.

\begin{sexylisting}{IPS verification}
show running-config
show ip ips
show ip ips all
show ip ips configuration
show ip ips signatures
show ip ips statistics
