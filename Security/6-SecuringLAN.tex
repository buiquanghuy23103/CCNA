\chapter{Securing LAN}

\section{Endpoint security}

There are two internal LAN elements to secure:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Endpoints:} Hosts  such as laptops, desktops, servers, and IP phones
\item \textbf{Network infrastructure:} LAN infrastructure devices interconnect endpoints and typically include switches, wireless devices, and IP telephony devices.
\end{itemize}

Protecting endpoints in a borderless network can be accomplished using the following modern security solutions: Antimalware Protection (AMP), Email Security Appliance (ESA), Web Security Appliances (WSA), Network Admission Control (NAC).
