#Note
  The holder <network> can be one of the following:
    any
    host 2001:db8:cafe:30::1
    2001:db8:cafe:30::/64
    
#Create IPv6 ACL
ipv6 access-list CCNA
  remark Permit PINK LAN
  deny ipv6 <network> <network> 
    deny ipv6 2001:db8:cafe:30::/64 any eq ftp
  permit ipv6 any any

#Apply ACL to interface
interface s0/0/0
  ipv6 traffic-filter CCNA in
  
#Verify
show ipv6 interface s0/0/0
show ipv6 access-list

#Apply an ACL to VTY ports
line vty 0 15
  access-class CCNA in

#Troubleshoot
1. Check the criteria of ACE rules
2. Check the order of ACE rules
3. Check the direction of ACL (inbound, outbound)
4. Check the location of ACL (which router, which interface)
  a. Extended - Source
  b. Standard - Destination
